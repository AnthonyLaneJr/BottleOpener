# BottleOpener
We are designing a Can Opener

Concept===================================================================

There will be two motors, one in control of vertical motion, and one in control of horizontal motion. The horizontal motion will be track based, with the vertical motion being a pillar that gets lifted via a cog mechanism inside of the vertical beam.

Once the opening process is initiated the vertical track will begin lowering the horizontal beam, until it reaches the height of the can.

There will be a sensor inside of the vertical beam that tracks whether there is an object in front of it, or not. If an object is detected, the vertical motion will stop, and the horizontal motion will begin. Extending a triangular structure to slide under the lid of the can and pop the tab open.

Upon opening the can, the vertical beam will begin moving the horizontal beam back upwards into its original position.

Currently the idea is to initiate the process with a button. Alternative ideas for beginning the process include using a pressure pad system, or using a sensor that views downward (this would be placed on the horizontal beam).

Intended Use Process========================================================

Step 1- Place beverage can in area.
Step 2- Once can is correctly place, press button.
This will tell the sensor to start operating. The sensors purpose is to lower upon can height. 
Step 3- The canâ€™s presence is sensed. The vertical motion stops. 
Powered by motor 
Step 4- Horizontal motion begins.
This piece holds the physical opener for the can.
The opener will slide across/under the tab of the can cracking it open.
Step 5- The can has now been opened. The mechanism will now go back in place.
Full rotation of horizontal movement.
Height will go increase based on time it lowered
Step 6- Retrieve can and enjoy.
